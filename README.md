# About
Actually I was making a File Compresion Tool, but could not get guidance how to do it. Then I thought that it is functionally like a tool that count characters in the file, so I uploaded it.

# How to use:
* Clone it.
* Open cmd or terminal, and go to directory location.
* Enter the command 'make' (without inverted comma), and hit Enter.
* Now place your file inside the directory.
* In terminal, just write "File_Zipper my.txt" (without inverted comma and write your filename in place of my.txt), and hit Enter.

# Thank You
